# Dreversed

## 🔄 About the Demo  
**Dreversed** is an experimental demo exploring the paradox of time by inverting physical simulations. Each scene is a reversed replay of a physics-based sequence, computed in the background during the previous segment. Over time, real-time physics and precomputed physics collide, creating a visual clash of temporal flows.

## 🎛️ Technical Details  
- Developed for **API8 Demoparty**  
- Written in **Lua**, using the **Harfang 3D engine**  
- Runs on **Windows & Linux**  

## 🚀 How to Run
